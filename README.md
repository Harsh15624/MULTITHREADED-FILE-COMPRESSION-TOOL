This project is a basic yet educational implementation of a mini-compiler in C++ that is capable of parsing and evaluating simple arithmetic expressions. It focuses on one of the most fundamental components of compiler design â€” the expression evaluation phase. The primary goal of this project is to simulate how a real compiler interprets arithmetic expressions by performing lexical analysis, parsing, and computation, following the standard rules of operator precedence and associativity.

This project has been developed as part of a Compiler Design internship assignment and serves as a strong demonstration of theoretical knowledge applied in practical coding. It is designed to help beginners understand how parsing and evaluating expressions work under the hood of a compiler.

The program accepts arithmetic expressions as input from the user via the command line, parses them using a recursive descent parser, and then evaluates them to return the result. The parser respects mathematical rules such as BODMAS (Brackets, Orders, Division/Multiplication, Addition/Subtraction), allowing proper grouping with parentheses and supporting both integer and floating-point values.
